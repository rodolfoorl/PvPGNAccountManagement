# PvPGNAccountManagement
This application was created as a hobby. Still needs many improvements.

#### Obs.: Don't notice the rough interface... I didn't have the patience to do something nice. ðŸ™ƒ

# What does it do?
The application's requirement was to read the users ***plain files*** and their characters ***charinfo*** and display information for search.

# How to use?
When starting the application, you will be asked for the location of the ***\users*** and ***\charinfo*** folders. You just need to search for them using the ***Search Button*** and click the ***Save Button***.
